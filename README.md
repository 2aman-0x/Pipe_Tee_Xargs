1) Find NO. of files present in a directory.  
    ```cd /etc```  
    ```ls -l | wc -l```

<h1><i> TEE commands </i></h1>

<b>Tee reads standard input and copies it both to stdOutput and to a file. We can see the information going through pipeline. </b>  

Example: ```ls | tee file.txt```  

<h1><i> XARGS </i></h1>

<b> It converts the stdinput into command line argument </b>

example: ```ls | xargs echo "hello"```  

<h1><i> To do: </i></h1>

file1, file2, file3, file4, file5  

Now take/read the name from FileNames.txt and create those number of files in the present directory.  

```cat FileNames.txt | xargs touch```
